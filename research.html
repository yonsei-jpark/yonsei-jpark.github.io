<h2>MIMO + Optimization</h2>
<table class="imgtable"><tr><td>

<td align="left"><ul>
<li><p>In 4G, the design of MIMO relies on convex relaxation techniques, such as WMMSE or SDR. The optimization problem is initially non-convex, yet we iteratively relax the problem to obtain a convexified solution. However, this approach has a significant drawback in that it leads to very high computational complexity, which is a major obstacle for implementing massive MIMO systems.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In 5G, massive MIMO has become a popular trend, characterized by the use of numerous antennas and a relatively smaller number of users. In such a scenario, we can achieve near-optimal performance without resorting to complex optimization processes, as a simple beamforming method suffices. However, this approach loses its effectiveness as the number of users increases.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</td></tr></table>
<ul>
<li><p>In 6G, we must consider massive MIMO and the presence of a large number of users. Traditional convex optimization techniques used in 4G are too cumbersome for this scenario. The 5G solution for massive MIMO is not ideal due to performance degradation resulting from a high number of users. Therefore, we require a novel approach to MIMO design, and we believe that our spectral approach holds great promise in achieving the demanding performance criteriain 6G MIMO scenarios.</p>

<h2>MIMO + Satellite Network</h2>

<li><p>Universal coverage is a persistent objective in wireless communications, and the integration of satellite networks with terrestrial cellular networks holds promise in providing seamless and ubiquitous connectivity services. Researchers have recently shifted their focus to satellite networks that utilize low Earth orbit (LEO) or very LEO (VLEO) mega-satellite constellations. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Given the exorbitant costs of deploying mega VLEO satellites, it is essential to characterize the coverage and rate performance of VLEO satellite networks. Conventional models for satellite networks involve placing satellites on a grid of multiple circular orbit geometries, such as the Walker constellation, which pose challenges for analytically characterizing coverage and rate performance. Motivated by this, we are interested in analyzing a VLEO satellite network using a tractable model based on stochastic geometry, extending the framework from a 2D plane to a 3D sphere. </p>

<li><p>Machine learning is undoubtedly a powerful tool for problem-solving, but to apply it effectively, a broader understanding of problem-solving approaches is necessary. In general, problem-solving approaches can be classified into two categories: model-driven and data-driven.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>The model-driven approach, which was commonly used before the advent of machine learning, involves modeling the environment and optimizing it using mathematical frameworks. Although this approach is mathematically interpretable and aware of system structures, it is vulnerable to model mismatch, which can negatively affect performance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>The data-driven approach, on the other hand, relies on machine learning techniques such as deep learning or reinforcement learning, rather than particular models. This approach is robust to model mismatch, but it is ignorant of system structures and requires a lot of training.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>We can combine them in a hybrid approach, called model-based learning. This approach leverages powerful machine learning techniques while also incorporating key system structures into the learning mechanism. By doing so, we can enjoy the advantages of both approaches and achieve better results in solving complex problems.</p>
