<h2>Attention-aided MMSE for OFDM Channel Estimation</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Accurate channel estimation is essential for reliable OFDM communication, yet conventional MMSE methods rely on hard-to-obtain channel statistics, and deep learning models often suffer from high complexity and low interpretability. </p>
</li>
<li><p>To address this, we propose Attention-aided MMSE (A-MMSE), a model-based learning approach that leverages an Attention Transformer to learn a linear estimation filter. Once trained, the filter enables fast and efficient channel estimation using only linear operations. A two-stage attention encoder explicitly captures frequency and temporal correlations in the channel, leading to significantly improved accuracy and robustness. A rank-adaptive extension allows flexible control over complexity, making it suitable for real-world 5G and upcoming 6G systems.</p>

<h2>Massive MIMO for Multibeam Satellites</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>In the MIMO literature, the principle of multi-user diversity has been extensively investigated, revealing several notable findings such as:
i) random beamforming is asymptotically optimal when combined with user selection
ii) near-optimal rate performance gains can be achieved through linear precoding methods </p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>In our work, we reinterpret multi-user diversity in the context of satellite communications, which are characterized by i) LoS channels and ii) 3D geometry with UPA antennas. Interestingly, satellite systems inherently align with the concept of random beamforming, as they typically employ fixed-beam precoding directed toward specific spatial regions. Our major findings are: i) When user density scales linearly with the number of antennas, the proposed precoding scheme can asymptotically achieve a constant fraction of the optimal rate. ii) To preserve asymptotic optimality as the number of beams increases, the user density must scale with an additional factor that compensates for the growing inter-beam interference.</p>

<h2>Greedy RF Chain Selection for MIMO ISAC</h2>
<table class="imgtable"><tr><td>

<td align="left"></td></tr></table>
<ul>
<li><p>In 6G systems, the role of MIMO ISAC (Integrated Sensing and Communication) is becoming increasingly prominent. The growth in antenna count necessitates a proportional increase in RF chains, resulting in substantially higher power consumption. To mitigate this, antenna (RF chain) selection has emerged as a key technique for reducing hardware cost and energy consumption in MIMO-ISAC systems. </p>
</li>
<li><p>In this work, we present a greedy RF chain selection for MIMO ISAC, in which candidate RF chains are sequentially selected based on their contribution to a unified mutual information (MI) performance metric. </p>

<h2>Shot in the Dark &ndash; MIMO without CSIT</h2>
<table class="imgtable"><tr><td>

<ul>
<li><p>In MIMO downlink systems, the acquisition of accurate CSIT has long been a major challenge, especially in scenarios with limited feedback or rapidly changing channels. </p>
</li>
<li><p>In our recent work, we propose a novel framework that avoids reliance on explicit CSIT feedback by leveraging partial channel reciprocity between the uplink and downlink. By exploiting shared channel characteristics, the proposed method directly predicts the downlink CSI from the uplink estimated CSI, enabling efficient and robust downlink transmission with significantly reduced overhead associated with CSI.</p>

<h2>State Estimation with 1-bit Observation and Imperfect Model</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>State estimation is an important problem for estimating a systemâ€™s hidden state, and Kalman filter is commonly used for this purpose. Most of the existing algorithms assume ideal environment (infinite resolution or full model knowledge, etc), so their performance degrades in real-world environments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>This work considers a state estimation problem with 1-bit observation and imperfect models. By using the well-knonw Bussgang theorem to approximate nonlinear inputs linearly, we get a linear filter structure while accounting for ADC quantization distortions. To overcome model uncertainties and nonlinearities, we propose a hybrid DNN approach that integrates Bussgang-based linearization with data-driven learning for robust and efficient inference. </p>
